            <p class="aboutpra"><b>
                A programming language is a notation designed to connect instructions to a machine or a computer. <br>
                Programming languages are mainly  used to control the performance of a machine 
                or to express algorithms.<br> 
                At present, thousand programming languages have been implemented. In the computer field, <br>
                many languages need to be stated in an imperative form, 
                while other programming languages utilize declarative form.<br> 
                The program can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics. 
                Some languages are defined by a standard like C language.<br>
                Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and 
                implementations,<br> 
                many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages
                with the implementation available only from a single vendor,<br> 
                which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property</b>
