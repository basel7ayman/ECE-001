                The history of programming languages actually dates back further than you might think.<br> 
                Early computer codes date back to the early 1800s,<br>
                and since then, we’ve created nearly 9000 different programming languages.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, many of these languages were specific to particular machines and 
                functions and aren’t used any more.<br> 
                What’s more, it wasn’t until the 1940s that the first modern computers were created. However,<br>
                many modern programming languages have their roots in Ada Lovelace’s first machine algorithm,<br> 
                developed for Charles Babbage’s Difference Machine in 1843.<br>
                <br>
                Today, people still use a vast array of different coding and programming languages.<br>
                However, the list of the most popular ones spans around 150.

            <h2>First programming language:</h2>
            
            <p>
                In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created.<br> 
                The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned 
                assembly language programs.<br> 
                It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required 
                a great deal of intellectual effort.<br>
                The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer<br> 
                were written in the early 1950s.John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949
